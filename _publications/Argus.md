End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities
in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting
growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on
public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may
compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand
for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor
driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is
crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.

To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework,
Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety
violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously
monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and,
whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a
hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end
ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus
effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the
driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to
64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.
