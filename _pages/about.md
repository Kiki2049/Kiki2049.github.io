About Me
------

🎓 I am a master student in [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) mentored by Prof. [Bihuan Chen](https://chenbihuan.github.io/). I received my bachelor degree in software engineering from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2023.


🌱 I currently major in software engineering and my research interests AI systems engineering, automatic driving system and simulation testing.

Research Interests
======

🤖 AI System Engineering
------

Assure human-centric, system-level and multi-dimension trustworthy AI (e.g., fairness, safety, security, robustness, privacy, explainability, interpretability, transparency and accountability) across the full AI system engineering lifecyle (e.g., develop, train, test, deploy and monitor).

🚗 Automatic Driving System and Simulation Testing
------

1) Simulation scenario construction based on a six-layer scenario model.
2) Simulation scenario reproduction driven by real scenarios.
3) Autonomous driving system testing based on fuzzy testing.
4) Automatic diagnosis and problem location of simulation test results.
5) A simulation test platform that supports multi-agent interaction and vehicle-road-cloud design.

Hobbies
======
📚 Reading, 🏸 Badminton, 🎾 Tennis.
