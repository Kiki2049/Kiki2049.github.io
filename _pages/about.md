About Me
------

🎓 I am a phd student in [College of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) mentored by Prof. [Bihuan Chen](https://chenbihuan.github.io/). I received my bachelor degree in software engineering from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2023.


🌱 I currently major in software engineering and my research interests AI systems engineering, automatic driving system and simulation testing.

Research Interests
======

🤖 AI System Engineering
------

Assure human-centric, system-level and multi-dimension trustworthy AI (e.g., fairness, safety, security, robustness, privacy, explainability, interpretability, transparency and accountability) across the full AI system engineering lifecyle (e.g., develop, train, test, deploy and monitor).

🚗 Automatic Driving System and Simulation Testing
------
* Resilience-oriented autonomous driving system design and testing.
* A simulation test platform that supports multi-agent interaction and vehicle-road-cloud design.
* Simulation scenario reproduction driven by real scenarios.
* Autonomous driving system testing based on fuzzy testing.
* Automatic diagnosis and problem location of simulation test results.


Hobbies
======
📚 Reading, 🏋️ Fitness.
